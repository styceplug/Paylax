            <p>“Our added value is that our clients pay the money BEFORE the service (transport) and still have the certainty that the money will not reach us and they will get it back in case of any problems. After the service is provided, the money is transferred to our account by a click of the customer. In the past, without PAYLAX, it was sometimes problematic to get the customer's money - reminders, reminders, etc. With PAYLAX, this is no longer the case and customers gratefully accept the protection.“</p>
